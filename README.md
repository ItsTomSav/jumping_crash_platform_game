# üéÆ Jumping Crash

A 3D platformer game developed in **Unity (2022.3.8)** using **C# scripts** for gameplay mechanics, UI management, and audio control.  
Inspired by classic platformers like *Super Mario 64*, *Crash Bandicoot*, and *ALTF4*, this project was developed as part of the *Human-Machine Interaction* course at **Politecnico di Bari**.

---

## üß† Overview
**Jumping Crash** is a 3D platformer game where the player controls a character named *Crash* through multiple levels filled with traps, moving obstacles, and enemies.  
The main goal is to **collect all coins** and **reach the portal** before the timer expires, combining precision, timing, and awareness.

The project demonstrates advanced use of **Unity Engine** components such as:
- Physics and collision systems  
- Animation controllers  
- Scene management and UI logic  
- Audio Mixer for adaptive sound design

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Overview

At the start, the player is welcomed by an interactive **Main Menu**, where they can start the game, access the tutorial, or modify audio settings.  
The menu design uses Unity UI components and animated transitions for a smooth experience.

The game is composed of **multiple scenes**:
- **Tutorial Scene**: introduces controls and basic movement.  
- **Four main levels**: progressively harder, with moving platforms, traps, and enemies.  
- **End Screen**: shows player score and stars based on completion time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Level Design

Each level introduces new gameplay elements that challenge the player‚Äôs precision and timing:

- **Moving and rotating platforms**
- **Traps and spiked enemies**
- **Cannons shooting projectiles**
- **Swinging traps**, **falling logs**, and **wind blades**

Here are some examples of in-game enemies and obstacles:

</p>

When completing a level, the **Level Complete Screen** displays the player‚Äôs performance with stars based on completion time and coins collected.

The environment design balances difficulty with player engagement, ensuring a progressive learning curve and rewarding exploration.

## üîä Audio Management

The game‚Äôs audio system is managed using Unity‚Äôs **Audio Mixer**.  
Each scene includes background music and contextual sound effects (jump, collision, coin collection).  
Volume preferences are saved persistently through `PlayerPrefs`, maintaining the user‚Äôs audio settings even after closing the game.

## üß© Game Structure

The project is organized as follows:

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Assets/Audio/** | Contains background music, sound effects, and UI sounds. |
| **Assets/Materials/** | Includes materials and shaders used in the game environment. |
| **Assets/Models/** | 3D models such as the player, enemies, traps, and environmental objects. |
| **Assets/Prefabs/** | Prefabricated reusable objects used throughout multiple scenes. |
| **Assets/Scenes/** | Contains all game scenes: main menu, tutorial, levels, and end screen. |
